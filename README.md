# ZoomTweaks
A BepinEx plugin for Receiver 2 that allows setting a custom FOV and timescale when aiming down the sights, for increased zoom and slow motion.
Essentially functions like a combination of [0xSmilingLizard's](https://github.com/0xSmilingLizard) plugins [SecondFOV](https://github.com/0xSmilingLizard/Receiver2Mods.SecondFOV) and [TimeControl](https://github.com/0xSmilingLizard/Receiver2Mods.TimeControl), though it only activates these effects when aiming down the sights and does not have a configurable hotkey (as it's triggered by Receiver 2's built-in aiming zoom).

Requires [BepinEx 5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and its [configuration manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager).
